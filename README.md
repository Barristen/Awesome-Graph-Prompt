# Awesome-Graph-Prompt [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


A collection of AWESOME things about performing **Pre-training and Prompt on Graphs**.

Recently, the workflow of **"pre-training and fine-tuning"** has been proved less effective and efficient when applied to diverse graph downstream tasks.
Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), the **"pre-training and prompting"** workflow has emerged as a promising solution. This repo aims to provide a curated list of research papers that explore the prompting on graphs.
